# Adding images to a .md file
We can add image to any .md file just by uaing the below syntax

![<Image Alt text>](<image web link>)

first we have a ! Sign. Then in the next square bracket [] we give the ALT TEXT.
In case the  image doesn't show up users could know what it is for from the alt text..
And the third part is a curly bracket () where we give the link to the image... First upload image to github
Then obtain the link of that image and then paste it in the .md file...

Eg: ![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

Shows an image of some cat
